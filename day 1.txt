1)INTRO TO P.E

Prompt engineering involves crafting precise and effective prompts to guide AI models in generating the desired outputs. It's a critical skill for optimizing AI performance across various applications.

----------------------------------
What is a Prompt?

A prompt is the input provided to an AI model to elicit a specific response.

The quality of the output heavily depends on how the prompt is structured.

WHY CHATGPT IS DIFF THAN OTHER TOOLS?
IT IS THE ONE OF THE TOOL WHICH WORKS IN A GIVEN PARAMETER AND USE THE ALL 1.3 TRILLION SEARCH RULTS TO OPREATE ON THE GIVEN PROMPT.
ITS IDENTIFY OUR HISTORY AND TONE IN SUCH WAY IT GENERATE THE RESULT
